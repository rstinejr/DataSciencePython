# Program Assignments for Data Managmement & Visualization

Work of Bob Stine for programming assignments for Coursea's
[Data Management and Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization/home/welcome)


The programming assignments analyze several per capita statistics defined across
countries. The data are from 
the [GapMinder data set](http://www.gapminder.org/).
The specific variables examined are alcohol consumption per year, income, and longevity. 

Project "first" is assignment 2 and 3, but the first programming assignment.  This code
converts quantitative data into nominal data and displays univariate frequency
distributions.

Project "VisualizingData" is the week 4 assignment.  It uses univariate and bivariate
graph routines to display the data.

I used the Spyder IDE for editing and executing the program.

I have a Tumblr blog, [DataScienceRules](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/datasciencerules), in which I post my answers to course assignments.
